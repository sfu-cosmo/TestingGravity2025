		<div>Testing Gravity 2025 will be the 5th Testing Gravity conference hosted by Simon Fraser University. Held at the SFU Harbour Centre Jan 29th - Feb 1st, 2025, it will bring together leading experts on various ways of testing laws of gravity. Testing Gravity remains a topical theme because of the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy and the long-standing failure to reconcile gravity with quantum physics. Like the previous meetings, TG2025 will feature latest updates from gravitational wave and astrophysical observatories, lab-based experiments, as well as discussions of recent theoretical advances. The conference aims to provide theorists working on extensions of General Relativity with a realistic perspective on what aspects of their theories can be tested. On the other hand, the experimentalists and observers will get a chance to learn about new ideas that their experiments can test.Wednesday, January 29th, will feature a "school" with five review lectures given by some of the invited speakers providing background into the key topics covered by the conference. The main conference, Jan 30th - Feb 1st, will include invited and contributed talks, and a poster session.

		<div>The registration fee is 400 CAD for regular and 200 CAD for student participants if paid prior to December 9th, 2024. After that, the fees increase at 500 and 300 CAD respectively. Banquet tickets are 80 CAD per person.The additional fee for attendance of the pre-conference school is 25 CAD. The school will feature five lectures by some of the invited conference speakers. Lectures will cover an introduction to General Relativity (GR), binary systems and gravitational waves, neutron stars and astrophysical tests of GR, review of alternative gravity theories, and cosmological tests of GR.
Registration closes January 27th, 2025. Cancellations are subject to 10% penalty, with no refunds after January 10th, 2025. Payment of registration fees is processed online by SFU Meeting, Event and Conference Services. All credit card transactions will be processed in Canadian dollars and are subject to current exchange rates and 5% GST.

		<div>Workshop Venue:The meeting will take place in the SFU Harbour Centre, located near the waterfront in the downtown Vancouver core. It is easily accessible from the airport and is surrounded by a vibrant neighbourhood.</div>
		<div>Accommodations:Delta Vancouver Suites:550 West Hastings St. (across the street, 239 CAD/night+17.5% tax)
Book using this weblink no later than December 12th, 2024. Alternatively, you can call Marriott Reservations at +1(844)254-5048 and provide the code "Testing Gravity" to get the above rate.Sandman Hotel Vancouver:180 West Georgia St. (10 mins walk, 135 CAD/night+17.5% tax)
Book using this weblink no later than January 14th, 2025, to get the special rate. If booking via the generic hotel website or by phone, provide the code "Testing Gravity 2025 - Attendees", or block ID 387717.</div>
		<div>For your travel plans reference, the pre-workshop school will start at 9 am on Wednesday, January 18th. The workshop will start at 9 am on Thursday, January 19th and end on Saturday, January 21st. Conference dinner is planned for the evening of Friday, January 20th. Arriving the evening before the meeting starts is probably the best way to schedule your travel, and you can stay a few extra days for a weekend in the city or on ski slopes. Further informaton about local attractions will be posted on local info page.</div>
		<div>Getting to Vancouver:Vancouver International Airport (YVR) is well connected to major airports in Asia and Europe and cities throughout Canada and USA. Deals can often be found on holiday airlines, such as Air Transat and Thomas Cook from Europe, or ZipAir from Japan. The best option for getting from YVR to the city is via Sky Train.Alternative Airports:Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre (CXH) is a seaplane terminal located within a 10 min walk from SFU Harbour Centre. An exciting option for people arriving from the University of Victoria, assuming the weather collaborates.Bellingham International Airport (BLI), across the US border, is about 85 km (53 miles) away from downtown Vancouver. Flying to BLI can be an inexpensive option if travelling from cities on the west coast of the US.Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) is 250 km (153 miles) away from downtown Vancouver. Flying to SEA can be a more economical option, even after taking the cost of the rental car into account.By Car:If you are coming from US by car, border crossing times depend on the time of the day. 10-20 mins wait is normal during non-peak times, but can easily be an hour if you happen to venture at the wrong time. You can get an idea about the crossing time statistics on various websites.By Ferry:BC Ferries runs several regular ferry lines connecting Vancouver Island to the Mainland. The closest terminal to downtown Vancouver is Tsawwassen. Although Horseshoe Bay terminal is not much further away, it is located on the North Shore. Connection over Lions Gate Bridge could be problematic during rush hour.</div>
