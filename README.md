Testing Gravity 2025
====================

29 January - 1 February 2025, SFU Harbour Center, Vancouver, BC, Canada
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing Gravity 2025 will be the 5th Testing Gravity conference hosted by Simon Fraser University. Held at the SFU Harbour Centre January 29 - February 1, 2025, it will bring together leading experts on various ways of testing laws of gravity. Testing Gravity remains a topical theme because of the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy and the long-standing failure to reconcile gravity with quantum physics. Like the previous meetings, TG2025 will feature latest updates from gravitational wave and astrophysical observatories, lab-based experiments, as well as discussions of recent theoretical advances. The conference aims to provide theorists working on extensions of General Relativity with a realistic perspective on what aspects of their theories can be
tested. On the other hand, the experimentalists and observers will get a chance to learn about new ideas that their experiments can test.

Wednesday, January 29th, will feature a school with five review lectures given by some of the invited speakers providing background
into the key topics covered by the conference. The main conference, January 30 - February 1, will include invited and contributed talks, and a poster session.
