<font face="PT Sans Caption" size="6">Getting to Vancouver:</font>
<p><font face="EB Garamond" size="4">
Vancouver International Airport (<a href="http://www.yvr.ca/" target="_blank">YVR</a>) is well connected to major airports in Asia and Europe and cities throughout Canada and USA. Deals can often be found on holiday airlines, such as <a href="http://www.airtransat.com/" target="_blank">Air Transat</a> and <a href="https://www.thomascook.com" target="_blank">Thomas Cook</a> from Europe, or <a href="https://www.zipair.net" target="_blank">ZipAir</a> from Japan. The best option for getting from YVR to the city is via <a href="https://www.translink.ca/-/media/translink/documents/plans-and-projects/frequent-transit-network/fast_and_frequent_transit_map.pdf" target="_blank">Sky Train</a>.

<p><font face="PT Sans Caption" size="5">Alternative Airports:</font>
<p><font face="EB Garamond" size="4">
Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre (<a href="http://vhfc.ca/" target="_blank">CXH</a>) is a seaplane terminal located within a 10 min walk from SFU Harbour Centre. An exciting option for people arriving from the University of Victoria, assuming the weather collaborates.

<p><font face="EB Garamond" size="4">
Bellingham International Airport (<a href="http://www.portofbellingham.com/27/Airport" target="_blank">BLI</a>), across the US border, is about 85 km (53 miles) away from downtown Vancouver. Flying to BLI can be an inexpensive option if travelling from cities on the west coast of the US.

<p><font face="EB Garamond" size="4">
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (<a href="http://www.portseattle.org/sea-tac/" target="_blank">SEA</a>) is 250 km (153 miles) away from downtown Vancouver. Flying to SEA can be a more economical option, even after taking the cost of the rental car into account.

<p><font face="PT Sans Caption" size="5">By Car:</font>
<p><font face="EB Garamond" size="4">
If you are coming from US by car, border crossing times depend on the time of the day. 10-20 mins wait is normal during non-peak times, but can easily be an hour if you happen to venture at the wrong time. You can get an idea about the crossing time statistics on various websites.

<p><font face="PT Sans Caption" size="5">By Ferry:</font>
<p><font face="EB Garamond" size="4">
BC Ferries runs several regular <a href="http://www.bcferries.com/schedules/mainland/" target="_blank">ferry lines</a> connecting Vancouver Island to the Mainland. The closest terminal to downtown Vancouver is Tsawwassen. Although Horseshoe Bay terminal is not much further away, it is located on the North Shore. Connection over Lions Gate Bridge could be problematic during rush hour.
