Testing Gravity 2025 will be the 5th Testing Gravity conference hosted by Simon Fraser University. Held at the SFU Harbour Centre Jan 29th - Feb 1st, 2025, it will bring together leading experts on various ways of testing laws of gravity. Testing Gravity remains a topical theme because of the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy and the long-standing failure to reconcile gravity with quantum physics. Like the <a href="../TestingGravity2023/">previous meetings</a>, TG2025 will feature latest updates from gravitational wave and astrophysical observatories, lab-based experiments, as well as discussions of recent theoretical advances. The conference aims to provide theorists working on extensions of General Relativity with a realistic perspective on what aspects of their theories can be tested. On the other hand, the experimentalists and observers will get a chance to learn about new ideas that their experiments can test.

Wednesday, January 29th, will feature a "school" with five review lectures given by some of the invited speakers providing background into the key topics covered by the conference. The main conference, Jan 30th - Feb 1st, will include invited and contributed talks, and a poster session.
